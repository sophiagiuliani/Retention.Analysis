 I made a retention analysis for a fictional company that offer subscriptions. The goal is to be able to see how long the subscriptions remain active 
and how much the retention rate drops week by week. With this information it is possible to check when the company performed better, and how long after the 
initial subscription the customers start to churn. A query was perfomed using cohorts, that aggrupated the subscriptions by the week they started. After that, it was calculated the amount of subcriptions 
that remained active week by week, up to the 6th week. 
      The results can be visualized in Looker Studio, using the link above.
