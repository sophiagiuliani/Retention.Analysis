# Retention Analysis
### Weekly Retention 


 The project was made based on data from a company that offer subscriptions. The goal is to be able to see how long the subscriptions remain active 
and how much the retention rate drops week by week. With this information it is possible to check when the company performed better, and how long after the 
initial subscription the churn rates are higher. 


A query was perfomed using cohorts, that aggrupated the subscriptions by the week they started. After that, it was calculated the amount of subcriptions 
that remained active week by week, up to the 6th week. In order to visualize the resultsm a table was created in Looker Studio, where it is possible to see the retention rates and some main KPI's such as: the number of active subscribers; median of subscriptions; and the average retention rate by week.
